Student Management System (SQL Project)

This project was created as part of an internship task to practice SQL fundamentals.
It includes database creation, inserting student records, and running queries for analysis.

The Students table stores details such as ID, Name, Gender, Age, Grade, and subject scores.
Ten sample records were inserted with different grades, genders, and performance levels.

Queries performed:

Display all students

Calculate averages by subject and gender

Find the top performer

Count students by grade

Identify high scorers in Math

Update a studentâ€™s grade

Results show overall good performance (average ~80%), top performer as Ananya Desai, and balanced grade distribution.
